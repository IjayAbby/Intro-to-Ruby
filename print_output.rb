#If you define a variable monkey thatâ€™s equal to the string "Curious George", and then a string that says "I took #{monkey} to the zoo", 
#Ruby will do something called string interpolation and replace the #{monkey} bit with the value of monkey. Therefore, it will print "I took Curious George to the zoo".
