Equal or Not?
# In Ruby, we assign values to variables using =, the assignment operator. But if we’ve already used = for assignment, how do we check to see if two things are equal? Well, we use ==, which is a comparator (also called a relational operator). == means “is equal to.” 

Example 
x = 2
y = 2 
if x == y 
    print "x and y are equal!"
end

# You can also check to see if two values are not equal using the != comparator.

Example 
is_true = 2 != 3
