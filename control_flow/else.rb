# The partner to the if statement is the else statement. An if/else statement says to Ruby: “If this expression is true, run this code block; otherwise, run the code after the else statement.” 

if 1 > 2
    print "I wont get printed because one is less than two"
else
    print "That means I will be printed."
end
